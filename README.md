# DIABETES_PREDICTION
Diabetes prediction using AIML involves analyzing patient data patterns, like glucose levels and BMI, to classify and predict diabetes risk effectively.

# Diabetes Prediction System

## Project Description
The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics. By utilizing the LightGBM classifier, this system analyzes a dataset containing demographic and health-related features to provide accurate predictions. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
